How to make a data science team work harder, better, faster, stronger?

1. **Harder**
    1. Working longer hours don't necessarily mean working harder. The better state would be when long hours (when they do happen) "don't feel like" long hours. Such state would most naturally result from being passionate about one's work. This is the flip side of the old quote: "If you resolve to give up smoking, drinking and loving, you don't actually live longer; it just seems longer." When "our work is never over", that would be hell for some, heaven for others.
1. **Better**
    1. "High quality research" are characterized as being:
        1. Correct ("valid"): Is the research statistically sound? Sadly, this is where many researches and "data sciences" clearly fail. 
        1. Clear: interestingly, "wrong" research typically result from lack of clarity.
        1. Concise: a long document is typically a sign of lack of clarity.
        1. Repeatable: is the code and document checked in? Can a reasonably smart new guy step in and repeat the whole reserach?
        1. Meaningful ("actionable")
1. **Faster**
    1. "Doing things quickly" more often than not lead to long term slowness. "Hacking" in 
    1. Due to the heavily interactive nature of data science, this happens very often.
    1. What's the good balance between speedy execution and robust, repeatable practice? Culture?
    1. Faster is not a gee wheez very quickly inventing stuff.
    1. Ironically, or paradoxically, slowly building the pipeline 
    1. Actually "better" 
    1. Some work are longer term and may not look like moving things faster.
    1. Hacking away something may look impressive and seems to "move fast", but one is simply accumulating technological dept. Many hacks
    1. This actually suggests "operationalization of data science".
    1. Any "operationalization" sounds scary. That's for sissy. The idea is to find the 
    1. Again, "good" is the enemy of the best.
1. **Stronger**
    1. I want every members in the team to get excited and grow professionally, especially in two areas:
        1. Toolchain
        1. Statistics
