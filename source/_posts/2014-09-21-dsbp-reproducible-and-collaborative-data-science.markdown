Although not quite in its full form, Professor Culich and Stark are on to something in their effor to 
move forward "Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science". 
Some highlights are:

* Starting with good overview in
[The Berkeley Science Review](http://berkeleysciencereview.com/reproducible-collaborative-data-science/), 
* ["STAT 157" topics](https://github.com/stat157/fall-2013/blob/master/topic-sketch.md). (definitely not a semester-long material; maybe 2 years?)


Looking forward to the more effort in answering this question:

> What should stat students need to learn for "Data Science"?

Maybe something in light of this [slightly tounge-in-cheek job posting](https://www.kaggle.com/forums/t/7034/data-scientist-cognius-profitable-startup-in-cambridge-ma/39041).
