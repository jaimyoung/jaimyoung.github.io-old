## 1. One lives by a handful of guiding principles in life.

1. Reducing is good.
1. This goes very well with "git/incremental changes"
1. This document lists those guiding principles in life.

## 2. Happiness: The more a person feels lucky, the happier he is.

1. Alternative expression would be "be thankful/grateful"
1. This could be a tautology. Happy == feeling lucky == be greatful.
1. One could also ask, "is the pupose of life to be happy?"
1. This is opposite of "entitelment". Having high bar leads to unhappiness.
1. This doesn't contradict to "strive for the best."

## 1. Happiness: Life should be about Doing Good. Not winning.
1. One will feel very unhappy if one's focus is on winning only.
1. SHould be about the process.

## 1. Having a **small number** of **high quality** things that you will use **every day** is desirable...
1. ... than having a **large number** of **mediocre things** that one **seldom** uses. (Or any combination)
1. 무소유. Very wise.
1. Francescan. Very wise.

## 1. In execution, strive for incremental changes.
1. Prefer improving existing ones than starting new things.
1. This applies to codes, docs, etc. Maybe not for big ideas. 
1. This is more about execution. Not inventing.
1. Git is the way to go.
1. Why incremental mind loves git
1. Git means perpetual improvement
1. Perpetual improvement means lost history and not being able to going back. 
1. Some writers write by dumping or xeroxing what's in their mind. Think Nietzsche. 
1. For other mere mortals yet oOCD enough to care about history there's git
1. Hence git serves those non geniuses who yearn to perform like genius. 
1. Can outer life be like git too?
1. No there's no equivalence in the model. 
1. 일신우일신 must be the closest concept. 

Git started with codes. 
The it becomes useful for writing and publishing. 
Will we see better and deeper writing in human scale? Possibly if enough people adopt them. 

## 1. In invention, strive for Moonshot.
1. Go for 10x improvement, rather than 10% of incremental improvement.
1. See google guidelines.
1. This is not contradicting "incremental changes principle".


## 1. Read books. Multiple of them. Read at least 5 pages a day. Every day.
1. See the 5-min life hack.

## 1. To get things done, do it for 5-min every day.
1. Useful life hack. Actually, one starts with 5-min but will keep on going.

## 1. Life tends to hit rock bottom during 40ies. Hang in there.

## 1. Conditons for Happy silver life: 관계성. 연골. 할 일.

## 1. Thingking **about** how to live is good. Actual **Living** is even beter.
1. I'm a how-person. Go out and live.
