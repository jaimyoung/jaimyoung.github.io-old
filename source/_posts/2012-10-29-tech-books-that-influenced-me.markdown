## Title: The Elements of Statistical Learning
    Author: Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman
    Published / Publisher: Feb 2009 (2nd Ed.) Springer
    Read: 2008

Absolutely the best introduction I read on key concepts and main techniques in modern machine learning and statistics. I picked up lots of similar ideas during my PhD years in statistics. But this book nice captures most of them and put them in good structure.

## Title: Perl Best Practices
    Author: Damian Conway
    Published / Publisher: Jul 2005, O'Reilly
    Read: Jul 2008

    I read this book way after I learned perl (along with emacs + ess) at Bell Labs in summer 2000. What I learned was:

    importance of readability
    importance of maintainability ("person who will maintain your code is psycopath and knows where you live..."). It's a manner of being nice to other people, as well as being nice to myself who'll read / use my codes 6 months from now.
    importance of documentation
    ... just importance of being nice to others!

But ultimately, his book helped me being familiar with lots of mostly good "conventions" that I can follow. Conventions reduces stress since one doesn't have to find answers / invent all the time.(cf. "Willpower" book)

Some people complain there is PBP fanaticism but those fanaticists probably is missing the point. PBP helped me write "better codes in perl" (oxymoron? "better" simply means easy to work ) and saved me tremendous time and effort in my professional career. Highly recommended.

Other tidbits (from the refcard):

    Always use {/x, /m} flags in regex
    Don't be clever
    Don't optimize code - benchmark it 
    Don't optimize applications - profile them


## Title: Freakonomics 
    Author: Levitt and Dubner
    Published / Publisher: Oct 2006
    Read: 2008

This book convinced me again that statistics was THE technique to extract useful and sometimes surprising information from the sea of data. Their description of multiple regression is one of the best I read.

It also was enlightening on the topic of child caring: "what matters for rasing kids?" Surprising, useful, and insightful findings including:

    Does reading books to kids at bedtime matter? - No.
    Does bringing kids to museul matter? - No.
    Do parents having books at home matter? - Yes.
    and so on.
    Fun stuff!


## Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness
    Author: Richard H. Thaler : 1945- , U Chicago professor of behavioral science and economy
    Cass R. Sunstein : 1954- , Law professor. U Chicago and Harvard Law School. (in office of Obama admin 
    Published / Publisher: Feb 2009, Penguin 
    Read: 2010

I totally agree with D Kahneman's review of the book: "How often do you read a book that is both important and amusing, both practical and deep? This gem of a book presents the best idea that has come out of behavioral economics. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to see both our minds and our society working better. It will improve your decisions and it will make the world a better place."

This was one of a few books that introduced me to these books along with some Malcom Gladwell's books such as Tipping Point and Outliers.



Key concepts:

    The power of inertia
    Biases and blunders when making choices
    Typical rules of thumb:
        Anchoring: you will estimate the magnitude of something by adding or subtracting a little from known magnitudes
        Availability: our worry is driven by our perception of the threat (swine flu, terror attack) than how statistically likely the threat is (obesity, flu)
        Representativeness: we tend to find meaning in random patterns that suit our theories
        Optimism and Over confidence: we overestimate the chance of success in marriage, business, investigation, ...
        Loss aversion: 
        Status quo bias: we are biased toward inaction
        Framing: choice depends on how the problem is stated
    Temptation
    Self control
    Mindless choosing: we tend to do things in automatic. 
    Self control strategy: 
    Choice architecture
    Good choice architecture mnemonics:
        iNcentives : design incentives in the system 
        Understanding Mappings: 
        Defaults: padding the path of least resistance 
        Give feedback
        Expect error (integrate systems to prevent them)
    Structure complex choices (decision trees; simplify and suggest choices)
    Applications:
        Saving money, investing, credit markets, social security, prescription drug plans for seniors, organ donation, saving the planet, privatizing marriage
    Extensions and objections
